; Enable changing the backlight with the scroll wheel (unreleased)
; NOTE: This may require additional configuration on some systems. Polybar will
; write to `/sys/class/backlight/${self.card}/brightness` which requires polybar
; to have write access to that file.
; DO NOT RUN POLYBAR AS ROOT.
; The recommended way is to add the user to the
; `video` group and give that group write-privileges for the `brightness` file.
; See the ArchWiki for more information:
; https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight#ACPI
; Default: false

; IMPORTANT
; To use this module you have to add your user(s) to video group with:
; sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
; Then users in the video group must have the permissions to write on the file
; /sys/class/backlight/your_video_card/brightness
; To do so use these commands
; sudo chgrp video /sys/class/backlight/your_video_card/brightness
; sudo chmod g+w /sys/class/backlight/your_video_card/brightness
